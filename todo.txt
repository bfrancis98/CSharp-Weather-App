MVP
User flow
[x] Ask for api key
    [] store api key in file
[x] Ask for location
    [] store location in file
[x] Ask for units
    [] store location in file
[] Display weather/call weather api

Dev stuff
[x] Function to create file
    [x] Check if file exists before creating
[] validate settings info before use
[] if file exists, do not run through set up. go straight to api call
[] error handling for incorrect formats

Future improvements
[] give a user a way to edit settings
[] 

Notes:
- Does everything need to be static?
- Why use async with main?
- This seems a lot like functional programming
- Should any of this be split up into different files?
- Should async be used whenever an api is called?
- Environment.NewLine is clutch. Good for cross platform.
- New line character is a string wtf
